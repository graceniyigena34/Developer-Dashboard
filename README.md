 ## Developer dashboard 
 
Developer Dashboard is a modern, responsive web application built with React + TailwindCSS. It offers a clean interface for viewing and managing essential metrics via a sidebar navigation, top navbar, analytics / stats cards, and interactive charts. The dashboard is ideal as a base admin panel or internal tool for managing users, projects, sales, or system activity. It is designed for easy customization and extension.
